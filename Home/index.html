<h1>Tommy the cat</h1>
 <p>I remember as if it were a meal ago...</p>
 <p>Said Tommy the 
  Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this awesome 
  
  prowling machine. Truly a
  wonder of nature this urban 
  predator â€” Tommy the cat had 
  many a story to tell. But it was a rare occasion such as 
  this that he did.</p>
